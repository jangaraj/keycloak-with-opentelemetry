      comment: Enable eval below to the remove the sourcetype field from Cribl Stream internal source type metrics. By default, internal source type metric events will set the sourcetype field equal to the reported source type. This can result in metric events being routed incorrectly. When enabled, the event_sourcetype dimension can be used to identify the reported source type.
