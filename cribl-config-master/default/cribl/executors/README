A directory of executors. Each executor is encapsulated in a directory, the entry point for the executor is index.js (in its directory)

The following are expected to be exported:

```
exports.jobType = <'fifo' | 'task-per-node'>

exports.initJob = async (opts) => {}
exports.initTask = async (opts) => {}
exports.jobSeedTask = async () => {} // the first task pushed to the queue
exports.jobOnError = async (job, taskId, error) => {} // callback when job receives error from tasks
exports.taskExecute = async (job, opts) => {}
```

Optional Functions
```
exports.jobOnResult = async (job, result) => {} // callback when job receives results from tasks, used for custom result handling/writing
```

If jobOnResult is not implemented, results sent to the job will be written directly to disk in the order received. Implementing will prevent
any results from being written to disk. The implementor may write the results to disk using `job.addResult()`. This gives implementors the
ability to write their own custom reduce step for their job.

```
exports.jobOnAddedTask =  async (job, taskId) => { }
```
Called upon task added with the newly created task id

```
exports.jobOnCompletedTask =  async (job, taskId) => { }
```
Called upon task completion with the task id

Optional fields (strongly encouraged)

```
exports.name = <string, name of this executor>
exports.version = <string, version of this executor>
exports.disabled= <boolean, true iff executor is disabled>
exports.waitForResults = <boolean, wait for results before finishing the job>
```

The job object passed as the arguement is a client to communicate information back to the owning Job with the following interface:

```
export interface IJobReporter {
  addResult(result: IResult): Promise<void>;
  addResults(results: IResult[]): Promise<void>;
  reportError(err: Error, taskId?: string): Promise<void>;
  addTask(task: TaskOpts): Promise<void>;
  logger(): any;
  finishJob(): Promise<void>;
}
```

interface TaskOpts {
  task: any;
}
```
